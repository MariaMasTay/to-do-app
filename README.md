# to-do-app


The user can add a to-do by typing the task and then hitting enter, the to-do can be checked off once done and removed with the bin icon. The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so will remain in its current state when the user refreshes the page. To delete the full list, the reset icon at the top clears the page.
